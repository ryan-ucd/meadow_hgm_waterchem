# Using Spin with R instead of Rmd
Updated: 2016-08-12

## Let's Write Some Notes on Meadow Modeling

The goal of the modeling is to identify relationships between water source 
(i.e., whether the meadow region in question is driven primarily *snow* or 
*groundwater*) and underlying hydrology/geomorphology. To identify potential
links, we will assess the strength of patterns associated with hydrogeomorphic
types (**HGM**), and water chemistry in conjunction with remote sensing data
from Google Earth Engine (NDVI and NDWI).

## Pilot Meadow: Van Norden

Van Norden is a large meadow at approximately 7,000 ft. 

## Load Required Packages
First step is to load libraries and data required for analysis.
