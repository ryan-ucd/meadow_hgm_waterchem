# Meadow Water Source & Hydrogeomorphic Typing

(*Collaboration with Center for Watershed Sciences at UC Davis & US Forest Service*)

---

This repository contains data and code as part of a project trying to assessing patterns of dominant water source (groundwater or surface-water) in a subset of Sierra Nevada meadows.

---
### Purpose
Water source drives surface-groundwater dynamics such that groundwater-dominated meadows provide more wetland habitat that is stable through time thus increasing meadow resiliency, increasing biodiversity, and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.

Our objective is to identify patterns and strength of associations between water chemistry, [hydrogeomorphic (HGM) type](https://meadows.ucdavis.edu/resources/18026), and remote sensing data from LANDSAT imagery (NDVI and NDWI metrics) to determine a potential method for assessing dominant sourcewater types in meadows throughout the Sierra Nevada.

### Data
Data from LANDSAT imagery were derived using Google Earth Engine code, HGM typing data were collected in the field by hydrology/biology experts from USFS and CWS, and final analysis and bayesian mixed modeling will be done using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).
